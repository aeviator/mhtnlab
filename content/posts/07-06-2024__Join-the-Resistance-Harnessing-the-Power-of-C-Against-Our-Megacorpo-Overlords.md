So you wanna join the fight against the corps that seek dominion over our world to control the masses? 

## "*Welcome to the Resistance*"

You'll stepping onto the battlefield unarmed. I can't send you out there defenseless; it'd be like sending soldiers to war without gear – a court-martial offense.

You will need a lot of training before you head to the frontlines.

But fear not, for in the arsenal of tools at our disposal, there lies one weapon more potent than any other: C.

### A Brief History of C

Ah, yes, C – the backbone of modern computing, the language that defies the shackles of corporate control. Its origins date back to the hallowed halls of Bell Labs in the late 1960s, where it was forged out of the fires of necessity by visionaries [Dennis Ritchie](), [Brian Kernighan](), and [Ken Thompson]() along with an Operating System known as [Unix]().

Born out of a need for a more powerful and portable programming language, C quickly rose to prominence, becoming the go-to choice for building operating systems, compilers, and a myriad of other software. Thanks in no small part to Brian Kernighan, who co-authored the first book on C with Dennis Ritchie.

But its true power lies not just in its versatility or [functional]() nature, but in its ethos – a philosophy of freedom and autonomy that runs through its very core. With C, you're not just writing code; you're wielding a weapon against the forces of oppression.

Still think you got what it takes to harness its power and take a stand against our technocratic overlords?

Proceed to begin your training. And as you do, remember this: C is more than just a programming language. It's a symbol of defiance, a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness.
