## Welcome to MHTN Lab!

Greetings and salutations! You've stumbled upon my own personal enclave in the digital realm (I guess it's your's too now). At MHTN Lab, I document my ongoing voyage of learning, exploration, and passions. It's great to have you here as we embark on this journey together. It's gonna be awesome!

### About MHTN Lab

I started MHTN lab on the 5th of June, 2024 as a creative outlet for my study, and to hold myself accountable. The world has been very generous to me; consider this my way of giving back. Join me as I share all that I learn this journey we call life.

P.S. Shout out to Dennis Devey - I would have never started this without you dude! Thanks for the inspiration and all that you do!

### Future Plans

I intend on sharing my knowledge in the form of college and industry standard courses, all for free, without collecting any data or targeting you with advertising. Did I mention there won't be any ads? Seriously, no ads, tracking or data collection.

Rest assured, I have no intention of selling out, as I believe this is my calling - a better, more private, and digitally secure world for all. 

### An Open Letter

I extend a cordial invitation for you to join me on this exhilarating odyssey of discovery and enlightenment. Whether you're a seasoned sage or a fledgling enthusiast, rest assured there's something to pique your interest and stimulate your intellect.

Thank you for gracing MHTN Lab with your presence. Together, let's embark on a voyage of discovery, where the journey is as enriching as the destination.

Adventurously yours,

Miro
