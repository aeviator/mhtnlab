## Welcome to MHTN Lab!

Greetings and salutations! You've stumbled upon my own personal enclave in the digital realm (I guess it's yours too now). At MHTN Lab, I document my ongoing voyage of learning, exploration, and passions. It's great to have you here as we embark on this journey together.

### About MHTN Lab

I started MHTN lab on the 5th of June, 2024 as a creative outlet for my study, and to hold myself accountable. Join me as I share all that I learn on this journey we call life. Consider this my way of giving back.

P.S. Shout out to Dennis Devey of [Roppers](https://www.roppers.org)! Thanks for the inspiration and all that you do.

### Future Plans

I intend on sharing my knowledge in the form of college and industry standard courses, all for free, without collecting any data or targeting you with advertising.

Rest assured, I have no intention of selling out. This is my calling. 

Join me in building a better, more private, and digitally secure world for all. It's gonna be awesome!
