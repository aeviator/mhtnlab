## Welcome to MHTN Lab!

I started MHTN lab on the 5th of June, 2024 as a creative outlet for my study, and to hold myself accountable. Join me as I share all that I learn on this journey we call life. Consider this my way of giving back.

P.S. Shout out to Dennis Devey of [Roppers](https://www.roppers.org)! This would have not been possible without him or Roppers, for that matter.

### Future Plans

Expect to see free courses on MHTN Lab soon. I am intent on making a college education freely accessible to everyone.
